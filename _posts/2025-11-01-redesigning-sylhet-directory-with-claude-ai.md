## Building Better: My Experience Redesigning Sylhet Directory with Claude

I've been working on redesigning [Sylhet Directory](https://sylhetdirectory.com), a local online business directory for Sylhet, and I have to say—collaborating with Claude AI has been an absolute game-changer.

### The Project

Sylhet Directory is a community resource that helps people discover and connect with local businesses in Sylhet. As with any web project, there comes a time when a redesign is needed to improve user experience, modernize the interface, and add new features.

### Why Claude?

What makes this redesign process particularly enjoyable is how Claude understands context and can work through complex design and development challenges. Whether it's:

- Refining CSS layouts for category pages
- Solving content card overflow issues
- Structuring category hierarchies
- Implementing responsive design elements
- Adding interactive features like embedded videos

Claude has been there every step of the way, offering solutions that actually work.

### The Workflow

My typical workflow has evolved into something really efficient:

1. **Identify the challenge** - Whether it's a styling issue or a new feature
2. **Collaborate with Claude** - Discuss approaches and get code suggestions
3. **Iterate quickly** - Test, refine, and improve
4. **Move forward** - On to the next enhancement

Looking at my recent project history, I can see the progression—from basic styling to more complex features like architecture directories and multimedia integration.

### What I'm Learning

Beyond just getting help with code, I'm learning better development practices, cleaner CSS techniques, and more maintainable code structures. It's like having a patient mentor who's always available.

### Looking Ahead

The Sylhet Directory redesign is coming along beautifully, and I'm excited about the improvements we're bringing to the community. The combination of human vision and AI assistance is proving to be incredibly powerful for solo developers and small teams.

If you're working on a web project and haven't tried AI-assisted development yet, I highly recommend giving it a shot. It's not about replacing your skills—it's about amplifying them.
