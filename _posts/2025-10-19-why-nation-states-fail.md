## Why Nation-States Fail

Why do some countries thrive while others fall apart?  
At the heart of the question lies how power, institutions, and inclusion are managed.  
Nation-states fail when they lose legitimacy, extract rather than build, and exclude rather than include.

### 1. Weak Institutions
Corruption, poor governance, and erosion of the rule of law weaken trust and state capacity.  
Without strong institutions, the state cannot enforce contracts, maintain order, or deliver services effectively.

### 2. Elite Capture
When a small elite controls political and economic power, they use the system for personal gain.  
This creates *extractive institutions* that enrich the few at the expense of the many.

### 3. Economic Decline
Overreliance on narrow industries, inequality, or fiscal mismanagement can cripple growth.  
Economic stagnation breeds unemployment, unrest, and loss of faith in the state.

### 4. Social Fragmentation
Ethnic, religious, or regional divisions deepen when governments fail to represent all groups fairly.  
Without inclusion, trust collapses and conflicts rise.

### 5. Loss of Legitimacy
When citizens stop believing that the state can protect or serve them, they turn away—sometimes toward rebellion or alternative authorities.

### 6. External Pressures
Foreign invasions, sanctions, or exploitative interventions can exacerbate internal weaknesses, pushing fragile states over the edge.

### In Summary
Nation-states fail not from poverty alone, but from **extractive institutions**, **exclusive politics**, and **broken trust**.  
Prosperity and stability depend on the opposite: **inclusive governance**, **accountability**, and **shared opportunity**.

*“Nations fail when their leaders choose extraction over inclusion.”*  
— Inspired by Acemoglu & Robinson, *Why Nations Fail* (2012)
