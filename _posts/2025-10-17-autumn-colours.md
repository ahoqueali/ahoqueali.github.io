As the year edges towards its close, the world softens into shades of gold and rust. The once-deep greens of summer now fade gently, revealing the quiet glow of autumn. Standing beneath this canopy, I can’t help but notice how each leaf — curling, browning, yet beautiful — carries a story of change.

The tree in the photo is halfway between two worlds: not yet bare, but no longer in full bloom. It’s a perfect reminder that transition has its own grace. The muted sunlight filtering through these fading leaves feels like a whisper, telling us to slow down, to breathe, to notice.

Soon, these branches will stand empty against the winter sky. But for now, they hold a final flourish — a soft, golden farewell.
