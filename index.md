# E-commerce App
I am currently developing [this E-commerce App](http://openjdk-app-commerce.193b.starter-ca-central-1.openshiftapps.com/shop/women/).  I am making the app for the likes of Ebay and Facebook entrepreneurs who have come to a point in their journey where they now want their own dedicated e-commerce site.
