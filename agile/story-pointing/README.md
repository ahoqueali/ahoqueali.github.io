# Story Pointing

## Why story point

Story points are used to forecast the number of backlog items that can be delivered in a sprint

##  How to story point

The story pointing of a story should be done relative to a base story that has been story pointed by the team

##  How to make storying point better

 1. Use grooming sessions to filter out not so well defined stories
 2. Use sprint retrospective to address bottle necks so that better velocities can be achieved in future sprints
