# Story Pointing

## Why story point

Story points are used to forecast the number of backlog items that can be delivered in a sprint

##  How to story point

The story pointing of a story in a sprint backlog should be done relative to a story that has already been story pointed by the team (datum story)

##  How to make storying point better

 1. Use grooming sessions to filter out not so well defined stories
 2. Use sprint retrospective to address bottle necks so that better velocity can be achieved in future sprints
