# Guiding principles for a tiny agile team
  - We shall hold weekly meetings to discuss prioritisation, bottle necks, themes, focuses etc.
  - Working code shall be our measure of progress.
  - We shall hold daily standups and use the standups to get feedback on the current working code and plan and manage resources for that day.
  - We shall use trunk based development for branching and releases.
  - We shall use Kanban for tracking work.
  - We shall apply continuous integration and deployment.
  - We shall be a self organising agile team so that any member of the team can hold meetings, standups and lead projects.
